# Middleware

The following code is an example of a route that authenticates a user with a username and password:

    app.post('/login/password',
      passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login', failureMessage: true }),
       function(req, res) {
        res.redirect('/~' + req.user.username);
      });

In this route, `passport.authenticate()` is [**middleware**](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) which will authenticate the request. 
By default, when authentication succeeds, the `req.user` property is set to the authenticated user, 
a login session is established, and the next function in the stack is called. This next function 
is typically application-specific logic which will process the request on behalf of the user.      

When authentication fails, an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response will be sent and the request-response 
cycle will end. Any additional functions in the stack will not be called. This default behavior 
is suitable for APIs obeying [**representational state transfer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (REST) constaints, and can be 
modified using options.

In traditional web applications, which interact with the user via HTML pages, forms, and redirects, 
the `failureRedirect` option is commonly used. Instead of responding with `401 Unauthorized`, 
the browser will be redirected to the given location with a `302 Found` response. This location 
is typically the login page, which gives the user another attempt to log in after an authentication 
failure. This is often paired with the `failureMessage` option, which will add an informative message 
to the session about why authentication failed which can then be displayed to the user.

The mechanism used to authenticate the request is implemented by a strategy. Authenticating a user 
with a username and password entails a different set of operations than authenticating a user 
via OpenID Connect. As such, those two mechanisms are implemented by two different strategies. 
In the route above, the `local` strategy is used to verify a username and password.
