# Strategies

Strategies are responsible for authenticating requests, which they accomplish by implementing 
an authentication mechanism. Authentication mechanisms define how to encode a credential, 
such as a password or an assertion from an identity provider (IdP), in a request. They also 
specify the procedure necessary to verify that credential. If the credential is successfully 
verified, the request is authenticated.

For example, the following command will install `passport-local`, a package which provides 
a strategy for authenticating with a username and password:

    $ npm install passport-local

And the following command will install `passport-openidconnect`, a package which implements 
support for [**OpenID Connect**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html):

    $ npm install passport-openidconnect

## Configure

Once a package has been installed, the strategy needs to be configured. The configuration varies 
with each authentication mechanism, so strategy-specific documentation should be consulted. 
That being said, there are common patterns that are encountered across many strategies.

The following code is an example that configures the `LocalStrategy`:

    var LocalStrategy = require('passport-local');

    var strategy = new LocalStrategy(function verify(username, password, cb) {
      db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', [ username ], function(err, user) {
        if (err) { return cb(err); }
        if (!user) { return cb(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username or password.' }); }

        crypto.pbkdf2(password, user.salt, 310000, 32, 'sha256', function(err, hashedPassword) {
          if (err) { return cb(err); }
          if (!crypto.timingSafeEqual(user.hashed_password, hashedPassword)) {
            return cb(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username or password.' });
          }
          return cb(null, user);
        });
      });
    });

## Verify Function

The `LocalStrategy` constructor takes a function as an argument. This function is known as 
a `verify` function, and is a common pattern in many strategies. When authenticating a request, 
a strategy parses the credential contained in the request. A `verify` function is then called, 
which is responsible for determining the user to which that credential belongs. This allows data 
access to be delegated to the application.

In this particular example, the `verify` function is executing a SQL query to obtain a user record 
from the database and, after verifying the password, yielding the record back to the strategy, 
thus authenticating the user and establishing a login session.

Because a `verify` function is supplied by the application itself, access to persistent storage 
is not constrained in any way. The application is free to use any data storage system, including 
relational databases, graph databases, or document stores, and structure data within that database 
according to any schema.

A `verify` function is strategy-specific, and the exact arguments it receives and parameters it 
yields will depend on the underlying authentication mechanism. For authentication mechanisms 
involving shared secrets, such as a password, a `verify` function is responsible for verifying 
the credential and yielding a user. For mechanisms that provide cryptographic authentication, 
a `verify` function will typically yield a user and a key, the later of which the strategy 
will use to cryptographically verify the credential.

A `verify` function yields under one of three conditions: success, failure, or an error.

If the `verify` function finds a user to which the credential belongs, and that credential is valid, 
it calls the callback with the authenticating user:

    return cb(null, user);

If the credential does not belong to a known user, or is not valid, the `verify` function calls 
the callback with `false` to indicate an authentication failure:  

    return cb(null, false);

If an error occurs, such as the database not being available, the callback is called with an error, 
in idiomatic Node.js style:

    return cb(err);

It is important to distinguish between the two failure cases that can occur. Authentication failures 
are expected conditions, in which the server is operating normally, even though invalid credentials 
are being received from the user (or a malicious adversary attempting to authenticate as the user). 
Only when the server is operating abnormally should `err` be set, to indicate an internal error.

## Register

With the strategy configured, it is then registered by calling `.use()`:

    var passport = require('passport');

    passport.use(strategy);

All strategies have a name which, by convention, corresponds to the package name 
according to the pattern `passport-{name}`. For instance, the `LocalStrategy` 
configured above is named `local` as it is distributed in the `passport-local` package.   

Once registered, the strategy can be employed to authenticate a request by passing 
the name of the strategy as the first argument to `passport.authenticate()` middleware:

    app.post('/login/password',
      passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login', failureMessage: true }),
      function(req, res) {
        res.redirect('/~' + req.user.username);
      });

In cases where there is a naming conflict, or the default name is not sufficiently 
descriptive, the name can be overridden when registering the strategy by passing a name 
as the first argument to `.use()`:      

    var passport = require('passport');

    passport.use('password', strategy);

That name is then specified to `passport.authenticate()` middleware:

    app.post('/login/password',
      passport.authenticate('password', { failureRedirect: '/login', failureMessage: true }),
      function(req, res) {
        res.redirect('/~' + req.user.username);
      });

For brevity, strategies are often configured and registered in a single statement:

    var passport = require('passport');
    var LocalStrategy = require('passport-local');

    passport.use(new LocalStrategy(function verify(username, password, cb) {
      // ...
    });
