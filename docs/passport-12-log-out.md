# Log Out

Passport exposes a `logout()` function on `req` (also aliased as `logOut()`) that can be 
called from any route handler which needs to terminate a login session. Invoking `logout()` 
will remove the `req.user` property and clear the login session (if any).

It is a good idea to use POST or DELETE requests instead of GET requests for the logout 
endpoints, in order to prevent accidental or malicious logouts.

```
app.post('/logout', function(req, res, next){
  req.logout(function(err) {
    if (err) { return next(err); }
    res.redirect('/');
  });
});
```
